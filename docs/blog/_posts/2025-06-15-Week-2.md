This week I started by extending the changes of RADI-2.4.3 to RADI-noetic in [PR #1051](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1051) which includes:
- 3 new exercises: Labyrinth Escape, Position Control and Car Junction
- New connection protocol on drones exercises
- Browser cache control
- RTF indicator in all exercises
- User Interface and performance improvements

The [issue #1021](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1021) [**connection protocol over drone exercises**] is closed but however a new issue must be created for the multi-drone exercises (currently only the drone-cat-mouse) because `commander check` only works good for a single drone model without somekind of identity number or vehicle name.

The [issue #977](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/977) [**iris models are spawned correctly but the drone does not take off through the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) takeoff method**] is solved for every drone exercises except the drone-cat-mouse exercise. The sitl problem remains with the mouse [iris-red] model. For other exercises, it was solved by fixing the path of the PX4-SITL startup  script in [PR #125](https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones/pull/125)

This week I also migrated the Rescue People exercise from ROS-node to Web-template based. The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to recognize the faces of lost people and save their locations in order to perform a subsequent rescue maneuver. Here is a teasor video of the rescue people exercise in web-template:
