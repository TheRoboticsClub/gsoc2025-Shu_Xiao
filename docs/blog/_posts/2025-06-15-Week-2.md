# Week 2: Writing and Testing a New Algorithm

After understanding the legacy structure last week, I focused on **building and validating a new algorithm** to test the current simulation setup. The original `MyAlgorithm.py` script was non-functional, so I had to write one from scratch to validate if the setup pipeline‚Äîincluding the perception and manipulation systems‚Äîwas intact.

## What I Did This Week

-  **Wrote a new algorithm** for the pick-and-place task using point cloud-based object detection
-  **Tested the algorithm in the legacy Docker environment**
-  **Confirmed that the simulation and robot control flow still work under the new logic**
-  **Disabled constraints in the "place" function** because the trajectory was constantly failing under the original settings
-  **Recorded a working demo** ‚Äî note that the first pick-and-place action has a slightly weird motion due to disabled constraints

## Known Issues

Even though the algorithm now runs successfully, there are still a few remaining challenges:

- The **"place" trajectory fails** when constraints are enabled ‚Äî possibly due to unreachable poses or tight tolerances
- The **Gazebo world is still incomplete** ‚Äî some models or markers fail to spawn


## Next Steps

Looking ahead, I plan to:

- [ ] Fix the **Gazebo environment** so that all required models and objects load consistently
- [ ] Start the **ROS2 migration** ‚Äî set up the ROS2 workspace and begin porting the robot and camera pipeline
- [ ] Evaluate better constraint strategies for "place" poses
