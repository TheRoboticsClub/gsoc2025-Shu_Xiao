# Week 12: Gripper Fix and Integration with Perception Pipeline

This week‚Äôs work focused on **fixing the gripper control** and moving from hardcoded positions to **perception-driven pick-and-place**. These changes mark a big step toward making the workflow more autonomous and closer to the intended exercise functionality.

## What I Did This Week

1. Debugged and fixed the **gripper control**.  
   - The issue was caused by a **controller path misconfiguration**, which prevented proper execution of gripper commands.  
   - After correcting the setup, the gripper now operates reliably for attach/detach actions.  

2. Integrated the **perception pipeline** into the workflow.  
   - Previously, pick-and-place sequences used **hardcoded object and target positions**.  
   - Now, positions are obtained directly from the perception system, enabling dynamic detection of the object‚Äôs pose.  
   - Verified that the robot can use these detected positions to successfully pick and place the object.  

3. Validated the updated workflow.  
   - The pipeline now runs end-to-end: perception ‚Üí motion planning ‚Üí pick-and-place with gripper actions.  
   - This removes the dependency on static positions and makes the exercise more realistic.  

## Problems I Encountered

- **Controller misconfiguration**: Incorrect path mapping caused gripper failures.  
- Minor adjustments were needed to align detected positions with the motion planning pipeline.  

## Solutions Implemented

- Fixed the **controller path** to ensure gripper commands execute properly.  
- Adapted the pipeline to consume **perception outputs** and feed them into the HAL API for motion execution.  

## Conclusion

With these updates:  
- The **gripper works reliably** during attach/detach.  
- The workflow now uses **perception-driven object positions**, replacing hardcoded values.  
- The system is closer to a fully autonomous pick-and-place exercise.  

For Week 13, I plan to focus on:

- [ ] Implementing the **planning scene** for better collision awareness.  
- [ ] Preparing the exercise for integration into the **Robotics Academy infrastructure**.
