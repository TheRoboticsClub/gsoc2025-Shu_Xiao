# Week 14: Testing the Planning Scene

This week‚Äôs focus was on **testing the planning scene** after restructuring the launch system in Week 13. The planning scene successfully started working, but there are still refinements needed before it behaves as intended.

## What I Did This Week

1. Tested the **planning scene integration**.  
   - Verified that the planning scene monitor is now properly publishing and updating in RViz.  
   - Confirmed that the motion planner responds to changes in the scene.  

2. Identified an issue with **object visualization**.  
   - The planning scene should only represent the environment (e.g., robot, table, workspace).  
   - However, the detected objects are also appearing in the planning scene, which can cause confusion and incorrect collision checks.  

3. Validated motion planning.  
   - Despite the object visualization issue, the robot is able to plan and execute motions with the planning scene active.  
   - This is an important step toward full integration.  

## Problems I Encountered

- The planning scene currently includes **objects from perception**, when it should only include static environment elements.  
- This creates unnecessary clutter and could affect collision reasoning.  

## Solutions Implemented

- Completed initial testing to confirm that the **planning scene monitor is active and functional**.  
- Logged the object visualization issue for correction in the next development cycle.  

## Conclusion

The **planning scene is now working** and integrated into the workflow, marking another milestone in the migration process.  
- Motion planning reacts to scene updates.  
- The next challenge is ensuring that the planning scene only represents the environment and excludes objects.  

For Week 15, I plan to focus on:

- [ ] Refining the planning scene so it only represents the **environment**.  
- [ ] Starting the **integration of the exercise into the Robotics Academy infrastructure**.
