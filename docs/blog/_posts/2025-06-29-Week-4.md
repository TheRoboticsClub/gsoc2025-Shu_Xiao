# Week 4: Researching ROS 2 and MoveIt 2 Migration

With the Gazebo environment and algorithm stabilized, this week focused on **research and planning for the ROS 2 + MoveIt 2 migration**. The goal is to modernize the entire machine vision workflow by leveraging ROS 2's improved architecture and MoveIt 2's real-time planning capabilities.

## What I Did This Week

- **Studied ROS 2 architecture**: looked into launch systems, node lifecycles, and changes from ROS 1 to ROS 2
- **Reviewed MoveIt 2 tutorials**: explored how motion planning interfaces differ and how to configure MoveIt setup assistants in ROS 2
- **Mapped out migration plan**: identified all critical nodes (camera, perception, planning) and how they‚Äôll be restructured in ROS 2
- **Prepared a ROS 2 workspace** with the basic package scaffolding

Although most of the week was research-heavy, this foundational work will guide the migration over the coming weeks.

## Next Steps

Starting in Week 5, the focus will shift from research to implementation:

- [ ] Begin **migrating camera and perception nodes** to ROS 2
- [ ] Configure and launch **MoveIt 2 with the existing URDF and planning pipeline**
- [ ] Test **basic motion execution** in the new ROS 2 environment
