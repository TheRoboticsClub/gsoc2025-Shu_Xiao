# Week 5: Setting Up with IFRA-Cranfield's ros2_SimRealRobotControl

This week, after discussions with my mentor, we decided to adopt the **IFRA-Cranfield/ros2_SimRealRobotControl** framework to structure our exercise. This package provides a highly modular and well-documented base for simulation and real-world robot control using ROS 2 and MoveIt 2, making it a great fit for our migration project.

## What I Did This Week

- **Explored IFRA-Cranfield's ROS 2 framework**:
  - Reviewed documentation, tutorials, and architecture design
  - Analyzed how the `IFRA_LinkAttacher` plugin supports stable object grasping and detachment in Gazebo

- **Evaluated flexibility**:
  - Tested how easily robots and end-effectors can be swapped using launch parameters
  - Noted support for many common robot arms, including Universal Robots and ABB

- **Set up the simulation environment**:
  - Configured our chosen robot and end-effector
  - Launched and verified the Gazebo world and MoveIt 2 pipeline
  - Confirmed the simulation is functioning end-to-end with proper joint control

This setup now provides a powerful and flexible base for integrating perception and task planning in the coming weeks.

## Next Steps

Looking ahead to Week 6, I will focus on extending the setup with custom perception and manipulation logic:

- [ ] Integrate camera and perception pipeline for object detection
- [ ] Use `IFRA_LinkAttacher` for simulated grasping during pick-and-place
- [ ] Connect detection output to a MoveIt 2 task planning sequence
- [ ] Update Gazebo world using assets from the previous exercise
- [ ] Spawn objects in the Gazebo world to enable interaction and testing
