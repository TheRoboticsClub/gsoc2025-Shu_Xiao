# Week 7: Setting Up a Dual-Camera Simulation for Pick and Place

This week‚Äôs work centered on **building the simulation pipeline for vision-based pick and place tasks** using a UR5 robot and Robotiq 2F-85 gripper, integrated into the IFRA-Cranfield framework. The goal was to create a simulation environment that supports point cloud streaming and object detection for manipulation tasks.

## What I Did This Week

- **Explored simulation packages**:
  - Tested the `IFRA_LinkAttacher` plugin for simulating grasp and release actions
  - Built an initial pick-and-place task using the UR5 and Robotiq gripper

- **Upgraded robot model with dual cameras**:
  - Mounted one camera on the robot end-effector
  - Positioned a second camera fixed in the environment
  - Successfully published point cloud data from both cameras

- **Added objects to the simulation world**:
  - Placed several target objects to prepare for vision-based manipulation

This setup forms the visual and physical context necessary for perception-guided motion planning.

## Next Steps

For Week 8, I‚Äôll focus on connecting the perception pipeline to the robotic action:

- [ ] Run and debug the vision algorithm using live point cloud data
- [ ] Localize objects for pick and place
- [ ] Execute grasp planning and test robot execution flow
