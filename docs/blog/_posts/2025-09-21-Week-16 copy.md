# Week 16: Full Integration into Robotics Academy and Final Submission

This week marked the **final stage of the project**, with the Machine Vision exercise now fully integrated into the **Robotics Academy**. The workflow, algorithms, and documentation have all been finalized and prepared for submission.

## What I Did This Week

1. Completed **integration with the Robotics Academy**.  
   - Connected the ROS2 + MoveIt2 backend with the Academy‚Äôs web-based interface.  
   - Ensured the exercise runs smoothly inside the Academy‚Äôs Docker environment.  

2. Developed the **algorithm for the web-based exercise**.  
   - Adapted the perception + manipulation pipeline for interactive use through the Academy interface.  
   - Verified that students can run pick-and-place sequences directly from the browser.  
   - Confirmed the exercise works reliably with dynamic object detection and manipulation.  

3. Prepared **documentation and final submission**.  
   - Wrote detailed instructions on setup, usage, and troubleshooting.  
   - Finalized the API and GUI guide for students.  
   - Submitted the project deliverables for evaluation.  

## Problems I Encountered

- Minor adjustments were needed to align the **exercise backend** with the Academy‚Äôs expected structure.  
- Some debugging was required to ensure the web GUI correctly triggered the backend algorithms.  

## Solutions Implemented

- Standardized the exercise structure to match Robotics Academy conventions.  
- Validated the entire workflow end-to-end in the Academy environment.  

## Conclusion

The **Machine Vision exercise migration to ROS2 + MoveIt2 is now complete**.  
- Fully integrated into Robotics Academy.  
- Functional web-based algorithm and interactive interface.  
- Documentation and final submission prepared.  

This wraps up the main GSoC development cycle successfully üéâ
