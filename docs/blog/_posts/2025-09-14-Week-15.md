# Week 15: Dropping the Planning Scene and Exploring Robotics Academy Structure

This week‚Äôs focus was on **resolving planning scene issues** and beginning the deeper **integration into the Robotics Academy**. After several attempts, I decided to temporarily move forward without the planning scene to avoid blocking progress.

## What I Did This Week

1. Attempted multiple approaches to fix the **planning scene issue**.  
   - The problem remained that objects detected by perception were also included in the planning scene.  
   - This caused false collisions and led to frequent **manipulation failures during pick-and-place**.  

2. Decision to **remove the planning scene for now**.  
   - Since the scene was introducing more problems than benefits, I disabled it to ensure smooth execution of the exercise.  
   - Pick-and-place runs more reliably without these false collision checks.  

3. Explored the **Robotics Academy infrastructure**.  
   - Spent significant time studying how exercises are structured in the Academy.  
   - Looked into the integration points between the exercise backend (ROS2 + MoveIt2) and the Academy‚Äôs GUI and APIs.  
   - Gained familiarity with the directory structure, launch workflow, and Docker setup.  

## Problems I Encountered

- The **planning scene still shows dynamic objects**, which causes unexpected collisions.  
- This blocked progress on manipulation tasks and slowed down development.  

## Solutions Implemented

- Decided to **move forward without the planning scene** for now to maintain momentum.  
- Shifted focus to **understanding the Robotics Academy structure** for upcoming integration work.  

## Conclusion

Although the planning scene could not be resolved this week, removing it allowed pick-and-place manipulation to work again. More importantly, I now have a much clearer understanding of the **Robotics Academy framework**, which will be crucial for integration.  

For Week 16, I plan to focus on:

- [ ] Starting the **integration of the exercise into Robotics Academy**.  
- [ ] Connecting the backend pipeline (perception + manipulation) with the Academy interface.  
- [ ] Preparing the first prototype of the integrated exercise for testing.
