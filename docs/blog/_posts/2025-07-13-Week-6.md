# Week 6: Updating the Gazebo World for ROS 2

This week‚Äôs focus was on **transitioning the Gazebo simulation world** from the previous ROS 1 exercise into the new ROS 2 environment using the IFRA-Cranfield framework. This marks a key step toward enabling a full perception-to-action pipeline in simulation.

## What I Did This Week

- **Updated Gazebo world assets**:
  - Migrated the environment setup from the older ROS 1 project
  - Adapted models and configuration to be compatible with ROS 2 and `ros2_control`

- **Verified compatibility with IFRA launch structure**:
  - Integrated the updated world into the IFRA-Cranfield simulation launch files
  - Ensured the robot spawns correctly in the new environment

This lays the groundwork for integrating perception and interactive tasks with physical context.

## Next Steps

For Week 7, I‚Äôll begin closing the loop between simulation and perception:

- [ ] Add camera sensor and configure topic publication in the updated world
- [ ] Spawn objects dynamically in the Gazebo world
- [ ] Testing the previous algorithm and debugging
