# Week 8: Migrating the Environment to ROS2

This week marked a major milestone in the project ‚Äî I have **fully migrated the simulation environment from the old Machine Vision exercise (ROS1 + MoveIt1) into the new ROS2 + MoveIt2 framework**. This completes the core infrastructure setup and ensures that the updated exercise is fully compatible with the Robotics Academy‚Äôs current system.

## What I Did This Week

- **Environment migration completed**:
  - Converted all launch files, configuration files, and dependencies to ROS2 standards
  - Updated URDF/Xacro files and robot description packages to ensure compatibility
  - Verified that the UR5 robot, Robotiq gripper, and simulation world load correctly in Gazebo with ROS2 controllers

- **System validation**:
  - Ran tests to confirm that all sensors and topics are publishing in ROS2
  - Checked integration between Gazebo, MoveIt2, and RViz2
  - Ensured that the environment is ready for functional API integration

## Why This Matters

The migration lays the **foundation** for all future functionality. With the environment stable in ROS2, I can now start bringing the exercise‚Äôs core functions ‚Äî vision processing, object localization, and pick-and-place execution ‚Äî into the new system.

## Next Steps

For Week 9, I will begin migrating and testing the old exercise‚Äôs functional code into the ROS2 environment:

- [ ] Port vision processing and object detection algorithms
- [ ] Integrate point cloud data into the perception pipeline
- [ ] Connect perception outputs to motion planning and grasp execution
