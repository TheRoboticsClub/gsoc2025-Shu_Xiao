# Week 1: Starting with the Legacy Machine Vision Exercise

During the first week, we identified a major issue: the current version of the Machine Vision exercise isn't working as expected. After discussing with my mentors, we decided to **go back to a fully functional version from five years ago** and use that as the base for our migration.

Before we build something new, we must understand what already exists. Rebuilding from a known working base allows us to:
- Pinpoint what made the original exercise effective
- Identify which parts need the most attention in the migration
- Lay the groundwork for a clean, modular ROS2 version with a user-friendly Python API

## What I Did This Week

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve completed so far:

- ‚úÖ **Reviewed the legacy codebase** from the old JdeRobot IndustrialRobotics repo
- ‚úÖ **Wrapped the exercise into a Docker image** for easier reproducibility and onboarding
- ‚úÖ **Created GPU-enabled run scripts** (`build_image1.sh`, `run_user_nvidia1.sh`)
- ‚úÖ **Successfully launched the Gazebo simulation environment**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed some typos in the original codebase** from the old repository
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Currently debugging the algorithm code** (`MyAlgorithm.py`)‚Äîobject detection via pointcloud filters is not functioning yet

- <strong>Initial test</strong><br>

</div>

## Debugging the Old Code

Although the simulation runs correctly, the core pick-and-place logic isn't producing the desired behavior. The color and shape filters seem to be publishing inconsistently, and TF frames (like `green_cylinder`) aren‚Äôt always available for object pose extraction.

Additionally, I encountered a few more issues during testing:

- Some parts of the **Gazebo environment are not fully loading** ‚Äî certain objects or models are missing or not spawning as expected.
- A number of **parameters are still referencing outdated configurations**, such as:
  ```python
  self.arm = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("irb_120")
  self.gripper = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("robotiq_85")
  ```

Next week‚Äôs focus will be:

- [ ] Hardcode a pose for testing motion planning only
- [ ] Visualize filter results in Rviz and the GUI
- [ ] Document findings and prepare for the ROS2 version
