# Week 3: Fixing the Simulation and Improving Path Stability

This week was all about **stabilizing the simulation environment** and **improving motion planning performance**. After confirming that the new pick-and-place algorithm worked last week, I shifted focus to the persistent Gazebo issues and unstable trajectories that were affecting the robot's performance.

## What I Did This Week

- üõ†Ô∏è **Fixed the Gazebo world**: resolved missing models and ensured all visual and collision objects load correctly
- ü§ñ **Improved path planning**: adjusted the configuration to make the robot‚Äôs motion more reliable and reduce failed attempts
- üß™ **Tested and recorded an updated demo**: the robot now performs multiple successful pick-and-place actions with better motion fluency

## Known Issues

While the robot now performs much better, some technical hurdles remain:

- The **motion planner still occasionally retries trajectories**, especially for "place" actions with tight approach angles
- Some **visual jitter** in the Gazebo camera feed could affect future perception modules

## Next Steps

For Week 4, I‚Äôll focus on:

- [ ] Beginning the **ROS2 migration**: initializing the ROS2 workspace and porting core nodes
- [ ] Rebuilding the **perception pipeline** with ROS2 compatibility
- [ ] Exploring **MoveIt2 integration** to replace legacy trajectory execution
