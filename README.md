GSOC 2025 Project 8
Migration and Enhancement of ‘Machine Vision’ Exercise to ROS2 + MoveIt2 in Robotics Academy

This project focused on migrating the Machine Vision exercise from the old Robotics Academy (ROS1 + MoveIt1) to the new ROS2 + MoveIt2 ecosystem.

The work included:
  - Porting the simulation environment and robot description to ROS2 standards
  - Updating the perception pipeline (color/shape filters, PCL integration)
  - Developing a modernized Python API and HAL for student interaction
  - Creating a web-based exercise integrated with Robotics Academy
  - Writing comprehensive documentation for maintainers and students
The new version delivers a robust, modular, and student-friendly exercise aligned with current ROS2 best practices.
