**Project 8: Migration and Enhancement of â€˜Machine Visionâ€™ Exercise to ROS2 + MoveIt2 in Robotics Academy**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focused on migrating the **Machine Vision exercise** from the legacy Robotics Academy (**ROS1 + MoveIt1**) to the modern **ROS2 + MoveIt2** ecosystem.  
The result is a robust, modular, and student-friendly exercise aligned with current **ROS2 best practices**, providing both educational clarity and technical longevity.


## ðŸ”§ Main Contributions
- **ROS2 Migration**
  - Ported the simulation environment and robot description to ROS2 standards.  
- **Perception Pipeline**
  - Updated color and shape filters with improved **PCL (Point Cloud Library) integration**.  
- **API & HAL Development**
  - Designed a modernized **Python API** and **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for seamless student interaction.  
- **Web-Based Exercise**
  - Integrated the exercise into the **Robotics Academy** web platform with interactive UI.  
- **Documentation**
  - Authored detailed documentation for **maintainers** and **students**, including setup, usage, and extension guides.  


## ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes
- A **ROS2-compatible exercise** that is easy to maintain and extend.  
- Clear modularization for **student experimentation** with perception, planning, and control.  
- A solid foundation for **future exercises** in Robotics Academy.
